# CM2 Image Gen

Show any type of image file in CM2*.
(*well, any image file supported by OpenCV.)

# Instructions

1) First, well, kinda obvious, but open CM2.
   ![cm2 opened](docs/cm2_opened.png)
2) Then, Open the tool.
   ![tool opened](docs/tool_opened.png)
3) Now, Choose An Orientation for the Image.

4) Now, Press Enter, and select a file through the File Picker. <span style="color: rgb(200,10,10);">DO NOT CHOOSE A LARGE IMAGE!</span> It is recommended to choose an image with a size around 100x50. I'll choose this Oreo that is pre-scaled to size.

5) Now, once you press "Open", after a splitsecond, the window should close. That's good! The save text for the picture is now copied to your clipboard. Go back into CM2, and there will be a button that looks like this:
   ![register button](docs/register_button.png)
   Click it, and a menu like this will show up:
   ![register menu](docs/register_menu.png)
6) Click the words "Plain text", and use the paste shortcut. Woah! All of the save text appears!

7) <span style="color: rgb(200,10,10);">MAKE SURE TO PRESS THE ENTER KEY</span>, then now try stamping the build. BOOM! YOU DID IT!
